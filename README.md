## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the economic status of cities worldwide by analyzing their GDP and population. Various aspects such as GDP per capita, economic dominance, and population distribution are explored through different Jupyter notebooks.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information on major metropolitan areas/cities around the world, detailing their estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population statistics as of 2022.

- **Position**: An index number starting from 1.
- **Metropolitan Area/City**: The name of the metropolitan area or city.
- **Country/Region**: The country or region where the city is located.
- **Official est. GDP (billion US$)**: The estimated GDP of the city in billions of US dollars.
- **Metropolitan Population**: The population of the metropolitan area.

## Analysis Notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks are included in this project:

1. **[Top 10 Cities by GDP](notebooks/Top_10_Cities_by_GDP.ipynb)**: Identifies and visualizes the top 10 metropolitan areas/cities with the highest GDP.
2. **[GDP vs. Population Correlation](notebooks/GDP_vs._Population_Correlation.ipynb)**: Analyzes the relationship between GDP and population.
3. **[GDP Distribution by Region](notebooks/GDP_Distribution_by_Region.ipynb)**: Analyzes the distribution of GDP within different regions.
